## Rationale

At Batangas State University ARASOF Nasugbu Laboratory School, the current student attendance tracking system is primarily manual, involving roll calls, manual entries in Excel sheets, and paper registers. This method is not only time-consuming and prone to errors but also lacks the analytical capabilities necessary for extracting valuable insights from attendance data. The absence of real-time visibility and automated reporting further complicates the process, making it difficult to quickly discern the number of absent students and take timely actions. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the attendance tracking system.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop and implement an automated attendance tracking system using facial recognition technology. This system aims to:

 - Streamline the attendance recording process, reducing the time and effort required.
 - Enhance accuracy in attendance data collection, minimizing errors associated with manual entry.
 - Provide real-time notifications to parents about their child's attendance status, fostering better communication and involvement.
 - Offer analytical tools to generate comprehensive reports and dashboards, aiding in data-driven decision-making.
 - Ensure a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and efficient management of the system
